* Version 0.1.2 (Mar 9, 2001)

  New features:

    - New C-c C-e C-l (or C-c C-r in REPL) to add a directory to
      Scheme's load path.
    - Guile 2.0 as lowest Guile version supported.
    - New custom variable, geiser-guile-load-init-file-p, to allow
      loading of ~/.guile.

  Bug fixes:

    - We no longer ignore geiser-repl-use-other-window.
    - Company mode integration fixes (including #32231).
    - M-x geiser-edit-module in REPL buffers fixed.
    - We now respect user customizations of geiser-implementations-alist.
    - Interaction with Guile's debugger fixed.
    - "Clickable" paths in warnings buffer also for Guile 2.0.
    - Fix for errors when entering r5rs modules in Racket.

* Version 0.1.1 (Jan 24, 2011)

  New features:

    - "Manual autodoc" command; C-c C-d s.
    - Autodoc retrieval is now asynchronous, for better behaviour in
      remote connections.
    - New C-c C-a to switch to REPL and enter module (C-c C-Z was broken).
    - Racket: ',enter "foo"' as a synonym of ',enter (file "foo")'.
    - Documentation typos, and grammar and layout fixes.


  Bug fixes:

    - Avoiding *spurious* buffers in case of communication errors.
    - REPL: fixed problem with input history navigation in Racket.
    - Autodoc no longer skips non-alphanumeric identifiers.
    - Autodoc messages no longer interfere with active minibuffer.
    - Fix for module name completion in Guile.
    - Quack compatibility: avoiding problems with #f &c.
