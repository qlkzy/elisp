Perl function to handle HPUX ioscan command
*******************************************

NAME
====

   HPUX::Ioscan - Perl function to handle HPUX ioscan command

SYNOPSIS
========

     use HPUX::Ioscan ;
     my $result = ioscan ();

     print "All hardware paths: ", join(" ", keys %$result),"\n";

     print "One device file of disk :\n",
           $result->{'2/1.6.0'}{device_files}[0],
           "\n";

DESCRIPTION
===========

   This module works on top of the HP-UX command ioscan. It forks a
process to run the ioscan command and parses its STDOUT. The result is
returned in a hash.

   This module is quite basic but it may be interesting if you need to
write administration program on HP-UX.

   You may call ioscan several time in your program without any problem
sicne the result is cached. Only the first call to ioscan will actually
run the ioscan command. (But you may override the caching of the result)

FUNCTION
========

ioscan ( [force => 1] )
-----------------------

   Will return the result of the ioscan command. The ioscan command is run
the first time or if the force parameter is set to 1.

   This function returns a hash ref. The keys of the hash are all the
hardware paths found on your system.

   The value is another hash ref containing these keys :

     bus_type
     cdio
     is_block
     is_char
     is_pseudo
     block_major_number
     character_major_number
     minor_number
     class
     driver
     hardware_path
     identify_bytes
     instance_number
     module_path
     module_name
     software_state
     hardware_type
     description
     card_instance
     device_files

   See `ioscan' in this node(1M) for the meaning of these keys.

   The value of device_files is an array containing the name of the device
files attached to the hardware path.

EXAMPLE
=======

   Here's an example of the structure returned for 1 disk:

     $result =
      {
        '0/0/2/1.6.0' =>
           {
             'description' => 'SEAGATE ST318203LC',
             'block_major_number' => '31',
             'cdio' => 'wsio',
             'driver' => 'sdisk',
             'instance_number' => '1',
             'is_pseudo' => 'F',
             'character_major_number' => '188',
             'class' => 'disk',
             'bus_type' => 'scsi',
             'hardware_path' => '0/0/2/1.6.0',
             'identify_bytes' => '0 0 2 18 0 0 0 0 95 227 197 13  8 127 87 40 32 ',
             'device_files' => [
                                 '/dev/dsk/c2t6d0',
                                 '/dev/rdsk/c2t6d0'
                               ],
             'module_path' => 'root.sba.lba.c720.tgt.sdisk',
             'minor_number' => '155648',
             'is_block' => 'T',
             'is_char' => 'T',
             'card_instance' => '2',
             'software_state' => 'CLAIMED',
             'hardware_type' => 'DEVICE',
             'module_name' => 'sdisk'
           },
     }

CAVEATS
=======

   The iocan command is run in blocking mode and may indeed block for
several seconds on big systems.

dynamically activate HTML links based on URL
********************************************

NAME
====

   HTML::ActiveLink - dynamically activate HTML links based on URL

SYNOPSIS
========

     use HTML::ActiveLink;

     my $al = new HTML::ActiveLink;

     print $al->activelink(@html_doc);

DESCRIPTION
===========

   I don't know about you, but one of the main problems I have with HTML
content is getting images and links to "turn on" depending on the current
URL location. That is, I like authoring one set of templates, something
like this:

     [ <a href="/">Home</a> | <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a>
     | <a href="/about/">About Us</a> ]

   And then having the appropriate link turned on, so that if I'm running
inside the /home/ directory, the above turns into this:

     [ <font color="red">Home</font> | <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a>
     | <a href="/about/">About Us</a> ]

   Without having to write a whole bunch of if's, or writing a bunch of
different sets of templates, etc.

   This module handles the above process automatically. By default, it
will activate any text or images with <a href> tags around them by
stripping the link off and changing the appearance of text and names of
images. All transformations are fully customizable, allowing you to choose
how your active text should look. HTML::ActiveLink can even automatically
construct imagemaps depending on your location.

   In the simplest case, all you have to do is create a new object by a
call to new(), and then call the main activelink() function which takes
care of the transformation. To customize what the output HTML looks like,
keep reading...

FUNCTIONS
=========

new()
-----

   This is the constructor method, and it takes a number of parameters
that determine how the output HTML looks:

     text              -  transform text links?  [1]
     text_prefix       -  prefix to add to text  [<font color="red">]
     text_suffix       -  suffix to add to text  [</font>]
     text_rmlink       -  remove <a href=> tag?  [1]

     image             -  transform image links? [1]
     image_prefix      -  prefix to add to image []
     image_suffix      -  suffix to add to image [_on]
     image_rmlink      -  remove <a href=> tag?  [1]

     imagemap          -  create URL imagemaps?  [1]
     imagemap_prefix   -  prefix for imagemaps   []
     imagemap_suffix   -  suffix for imagemaps   [_on]
     imagemap_joinchar -  join parts with char   [_]
     imagemap_rootname -  imagemap name for /    [home]
     imagemap_dirdepth -  max dir levels to use  [2]

   The first set of args determines how to transform text links. By
default, any text links will be changed into red text when you're in the
directory or document that they point to (see below for more explicit
details). To change this, just change the prefix and suffix, for example:

     my $al = HTML::ActiveLink->new(text_prefix => '<b>',
                                    text_suffix => ' &gt;</b>');

   This will make the active links bold, with a > sign after them as well.
A similar principle works for images. By default, an image link like so:

     <a href="/home/"><img src="/images/home.gif"></a>

   Will be transformed to:

     <img src="/images/home_on.gif">

   Notice that the file type suffix is preserved, and that the image
suffix is properly applied to the name of the image. Again, to change the
suffix or prefix simply change the image_ parameters.

   Finally, this module will automatically *construct* imagemaps based on
the current URL. Unlike the two above methods, which involve parsing and
modifying existing content, the imagemap creation instead creates the name
of the imagemap dynamically.  This is done since imagemaps contain
multiple links, so each one represents many areas to click on.

   For example, if you are running in the directory /faq/, and you have an
imagemap that looks like this:

     <img src="/images/tab.gif" usemap="#nav">

   Then the image src will be rewritten as:

     <img src="/images/tab_faq_on.gif" usemap="#nav">

   Here, the name of the imagemap is rewritten similarly to images, only
depending on your location. The directory information is inserted in after
the name of the image that exists, along with the suffix. The imagemap
name is created by joining together the directory name(s) for your current
location, up to 2 deep by default. More examples:

     /faq/            = tab_faq_on.gif
     /                = tab_home_on.gif (depending on _rootname)
     /name/g.html     = tab_name_on.gif
     /id/N/NW/NWIGER/ = tab_id_N_on.gif (note only first 2 used)

   The second one depends on what you've set imagemap_rootname to, since
this is what is used to determine the name for /. In the last example,
notice that only 2 dir levels are used by default, meaning that huge dir
trees do not result in tons of different imagemap names. To change this,
set imagemap_dirdepth.

activelink()
------------

   This is the function that actually parses the document and activates
all the necessary links. It joins its arguments into a scalar
representation of the file and returns that, which can then be printed out
or manipulated further. Examples:

     print $al->activelink(@doc);
     print $al->activelink($part1, $part2, $part3);
     $doc = $al->activelink(<STDIN>);

   And so on. To change how it works, pass different values to the new()
function described above.

   The activelink() function uses regular expressions to match the
location so that anything deeper than a link is activated.  So, assuming
this link:

     <a href="/news/today/">Today's News</a>

   Then any of the following locations would cause it to be active:

     /news/today/
     /news/today/presidential_election_still_undecided.html
     /news/today/regional/san_diego_headlines.html

   But none of these would:

     /news/
     /news/today.html
     /news/today

   Just like with Apache configs, the path needs to be matched completely,
and then anything beneath that path works as well.

APPLICATIONS
============

   One simple use of this module that I like is creating a simple script
called "header.cgi" that just looks something like this:

     use HTML::ActiveLink;
     my $al = HTML::ActiveLink->new(text_prefix => '<b>',
                                    text_suffix => '</b>');

     my $header = '/path/to/header.html';
     open(HEADER, "<$header") or die $!;
     print $al->activelink(<HEADER>);

   Then, I can use this in my SSI documents like so:

     <!--#include "../cgi-bin/header.cgi"-->

   And presto! All my SSI .shtml documents have a header which has links
that are automatically activated based on the document location.  You
could, of course, beef up the "header.cgi" script so that it used the name
of a file passed as a parameter, etc, depending on what you want to do.

functions that construct a HTML syntax tree
*******************************************

NAME
====

   HTML::AsSubs - functions that construct a HTML syntax tree

SYNOPSIS
========

     use HTML::AsSubs;
     $h = body(
     	   h1("This is the heading"),
     	   p("This is the first paragraph which contains a ",
     	     a({href=>'link.html'}, "link"),
     	     " and an ",
     	     img({src=>'img.gif', alt=>'image'}),
     	     "."
     	    ),
     	  );
     print $h->as_HTML;

DESCRIPTION
===========

   This module exports functions that can be used to construct various
HTML elements. The functions are named after the tags of the correponding
HTML element and are all written in lower case. If the first argument is a
hash reference then it will be used to initialize the attributes of this
element. The remaining arguments are regarded as content.

   For a similar idea (i.e., it's another case where the syntax tree of
the Perl source mirrors the syntax tree of the HTML produced), see
HTML::Element's `new_from_lol' method.

   For what I now think is a cleaner implementation of this same idea, see
the excellent module `XML::Generator', which is what I suggest for actual
real-life use.  (I suggest this over `HTML::AsSubs' and over `CGI.pm''s
HTML-making functions.)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
===============

   This module was inspired by the following message:

     Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 16:11:30 +0100
     Subject: Wow! I have a large lightbulb above my head!

     Take a moment to consider these lines:

     %OVERLOAD=( '""' => sub { join("", @{$_[0]}) } );

     sub html { my($type)=shift; bless ["<$type>", @_, "</$type>"]; }

     :-)  I *love* Perl 5!  Thankyou Larry and Ilya.

     Regards,
     Tim Bunce.

     p.s. If you didn't get it, think about recursive data types: html(html())
     p.p.s. I'll turn this into a much more practical example in a day or two.
     p.p.p.s. It's a pity that overloads are not inherited. Is this a bug?

BUGS
====

   The exported link() function overrides the builtin link() function.
The exported tr() function must be called using &tr(...) syntax because it
clashes with the builtin tr/../../ operator.

Perl extension for generating and manipulating HTML calendar months
*******************************************************************

NAME
====

   HTML::CalendarMonth - Perl extension for generating and manipulating
HTML calendar months

SYNOPSIS
========

     use HTML::CalendarMonth;
     use HTML::AsSubs;

     # Using HTML::AsSubs
     $c = HTML::CalendarMonth->new( month => 3, year => 69 );
     $c->item($c->year, $c->month)->attr(bgcolor => 'wheat');
     $c->item($c->year, $c->month)->wrap_content(font({size => '+2'}));
     $c->item(12, 16, 28)->wrap_content(strong());
     print $c->as_HTML;

     # Using regular HTML::Element creation
     $c2 = HTML::CalendarMonth->new( month => 8, year => 79 );
     $c2->item($c2->year, $c2->month)->attr(bgcolor => 'wheat');
     $f = HTML::Element->new('font', size => '+2');
     $c2->item($c2->year, $c2->month)->wrap_content($f);
     $c2->item_daycol('Su', 'Sa')->attr(bgcolor => 'cyan');
     print $c2->as_HTML;

DESCRIPTION
===========

   HTML::CalendarMonth is a subclass of HTML::ElementTable. See
`HTML::ElementTable(3)' in this node for how that class works, for it
affects this module on many levels. Like HTML::ElementTable,
HTML::CalendarMonth behaves as if it were an HTML::ElementSuper, which is
a regular HTML::Element with methods added to easily manipulate the
appearance of the HTML table containing the calendar.

   The primary interaction with HTML::CalendarMonth is through items. An
item is merely a symbol that represents the content of the cell of
interest within the calendar. For instance, the element representing the
14th day of the month would be returned by `$c->item(14)'. Similarly, the
element representing the header for Monday would be returned by
`$c->item('Mo')'. If the year happened to by 1984, then `$c->item(1984)'
would return the cell representing the year. Since years and particular
months change frequently, it is probably more useful to take advantage of
the month() and year() methods, which return the respective item symbol
for the current calendar. In the prior example, using 1984, the following
is equivalent: `$c->item($c->year())'.

   Multiple cells of the calendar can be manipulated as if they were a
single element. For instance, `$c->item(15)->attr(bgcolor => 'cyan')'
would alter the background color of the cell representing the 15th. By the
same token, `$c->item(15, 16, 17, 23)->attr(bgcolor => 'cyan')' would do
the same thing for all cells containing the item symbols passed to the
item() method.

   The calendar structure is still nothing more than a table structure;
the same table structure provided by the HTML::ElementTable class. In
addition to the item based access methods above, calendar cells can still
be accessed using row and column grid coordinates using the `cell()'
method provided by the table class. All coordinate-based methods in the
table class are accessible to the calendar class.

   The module includes support for week-of-the-year numbering, arbitrary
1st day of the week definitions, and aliasing so that you can express any
element in any language HTML can handle.

   Dates that are beyond the range of the built-in time functions of perl
are handled either by the 'cal' command, Date::Calc, or Date::Manip. The
presence of any one of these utilities and modules will suffice for these
far flung date calculations. If you want to use week-of-year numbering,
then either one of the date modules is required.

METHODS
=======

   All arguments appearing in [brackets] are optional, and do not
represent anonymous array references.

   Constructor

new()
     With no arguments, the constructor will return a calendar object
     representing the current month with a default appearance.  The initial
     configuration of the calendar is controlled by special attributes.
     Non-calendar related attributes are passed along to
     HTML::ElementTable. Any non-table related attributes left after that
     are passed to HTML::Element while constructing the <table> tag. See
     *Note HTML/ElementTable: HTML/ElementTable, if you are interested in
     attributes that can be passed along to that class.

     Special Attributes for HTML::CalendarMonth:

    month
          1-12, or Jan-Dec.  Defaults to current month.

    year
          Four digit representation. Defaults to current year.

    head_m
          Specifies whether to display the month header. Default 1.

    head_y
          Specifies whether to display the year header. Default 1.

    head_dow
          Specifies whether to display days of the week header. Default 1.

    head_week
          Specifies whether to display the week-of-year numbering. Default
          0.

    week_begin
          Specify first day of the week, which can be 1..7, starting with
          Sunday. Defaults to 1, or Sunday. In order to specify Monday,
          set this to 2, and so on.

    row_offset
          Specifies the offset of the first calendar row within the table
          containing the calendar. This is 0 by default, making the first
          row of the table the same as the first row of the calendar.

    col_offset
          Specifies the offset of the first calendar column within the
          table containing the calendar. This is 0 by default, making the
          first column of the table the same as the first row of the
          calendar.

    historic
          This option is ignored for dates that do not exceed the range of
          the built-in perl time functions. For dates that do exceed these
          ranges, this option specifies the default calculation method.
          When set, if the 'cal' utility is available on your system, that
          will be used rather than the Date::Calc or Date::Manip modules.
          This can be an issue since the date modules blindly extrapolate
          the Gregorian calendar, whereas 'cal' takes some of these quirks
          into account. If 'cal' is not available on your system, this
          attribute is meaningless.  Defaults to 1.

   *Item Query Methods*

   The following methods return lists of item symbols that are related in
some way to the provided list of items. The returned symbols may then be
used as arguments to the glob methods detailed further below.  When these
methods deal with 'rows' and 'columns', they are only concerned with the
cells in the calendar - not the cells that might be present in the
surrounding table if you have extended it. If you have not set row or
column offsets, or extended the span of the containing table, then these
rows and columns are functionally equivalent to the table rows and columns.

row_items(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns all item symbols in rows shared by the provided item symbols.

col_items(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns all item symbols in columns shared by the provided item
     symbols.

daycol_items(col_item1, [col_item2, ...])
     Same as col_items(), but the returned item symbols are limited to
     those that are not header items (month, year, day-of-week).

row_of(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns the row numbers of rows containing the provided item symbols.

col_of(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns the column numbers of columns containing the provided item
     symbols.

lastday()
     Returns the number of the last day of the month.

dow1st()
     Returns the column number for the first day of the month.

days()
     Returns a list of all days of the month.

dayheaders()
     Returns a list of all day headers (Su..Sa)

headers()
     Returns a list of all headers (month, year, dayheaders)

items()
     Returns a list of all item symbols in the calendar.

first_col()
     Returns the number of the first column of the calendar. This could be
     different from that of the surrounding table if the table was
     extended, but otherwise should be identical.

last_col()
     Returns the number of the last column of the calendar. This could be
     different from that of the surrounding table if the table was
     extended, but should otherwise be identical.

first_row()
     Returns the number of the first row of the calendar. This could be
     different from that of the surrounding table if offsets were made.

first_week_row()
     Returns the number of the first row of the calendar containing day
     items (ie, the first week). This could vary depending on table offsets
     and header modes.

last_row()
     Returns the number of the last row of the calendar. This could be
     different from that of the surrounding table if the table was
     extended, but should otherwise be identical.

   *Glob Methods*

   Glob methods return references that are functionally equivalent to an
individual calendar cell. Mostly, they provide item based analogues to the
glob methods provided in HTML::ElementTable. In methods dealing with rows,
columns, and boxes, the globs include empty calendar cells (which would
otherwise need to be accessed through native HTML::ElementTable methods).
The row and column numbers returned by the item methods above are
compatible with the grid based methods in HTML::ElementTable.

   For details on how these globs work, check out *Note HTML/ElementTable:
HTML/ElementTable, and *Note HTML/ElementGlob: HTML/ElementGlob,.

item(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns all cells containing the provided item symbols.

item_row(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns all cells in all rows occupied by the provided item symbols.

item_col(item1, [item2, ...])
     Returns all cells in all columns occupied by the provided item
     symbols.

item_daycol(item1, [item2, ...])
     Same as item_col(), except limits the cells to non header cells.

item_box(item1a, item1b, [item2a, item2b, ...])
     Returns all cells in the boxes defined by the item pairs provided.

allheaders()
     Returns all header cells.

alldays()
     Returns all non header cells, including empty cells.

all()
     Returns all cells in the calendar, including empty cells.

   *Transformation Methods*

   The following methods provide ways of translating between various item
symbols, coordinates, and other representations.

coords_of(item)
     Returns the row and column of the provided item symbol, for use with
     the grid based methods in HTML::ElementTable.

item_at(row,column)
     Returns the item symbol of the item at the provided coordinates, for
     use with the item based methods of HTML::CalendarMonth.

monthname(monthnum)
     Returns the name (item symbol) of the month number provided, where
     *monthnum* can be 1..12.

monthnum(monthname)
     Returns the number (1..12) of the month name provided. Only a minimal
     case-insensitive match on the month name is necessary; the proper item
     symbol for the month will be determined from this match.

dayname(daynum)
     Returns the name (item symbol) of the day of week header for a number
     of a day of the week, where *daynum* is 1..7.

daynum(dayname)
     Returns the number of the day of the week given the symbolic name for
     that day (Su..Sa).

daytime(day)
     Returns the number in seconds since the epoch for a given day. The day
     must be present in the current calendar.

Notes On Dates And Spatial Relationships
========================================

   One of the nice things about having a calendar represented as a table
accessible with grid coordinates is that some of the trickier date
calculations become trivial. You can use packages such as Date::Manip or
*Date::Calc* for these sort of things, but the algorithms are often
derived from a common human activity: looking at a calendar on a wall.
Say, for instance, that you are interested in "the third Friday of every
month". If you are using a calendar with Sunday as the first day of the
week, then Fridays will always be in column 5, starting from 0. Likewise,
due to the fact that supressed headers are merely *masked* in the actual
table, the first row with dates in a calendar structure will always be 2,
even if the month, year, or day headers are disabled. The third friday of
every month therefore becomes `$c->cell(2,5)', regardless of the particular
month. Likewise, the "nth dayname/week of the month" can always be mapped
to table coordinates.

   The particulars of this grid mapping are affected if you have redefined
what the first day of the week is, or if you have tweaked the table beyond
the bounds of the calendar itself. There are methods that can help under
these circumstances, though. For instance, in our example where we are
interested in the 3rd Friday of the month, the row number is accessed with
`$c->first_week_row + 2', whereas the column number could be derived with
`$c->last_col - 1'.

Perl Module for Generating HTML Calendars
*****************************************

NAME
====

   HTML::CalendarMonthSimple - Perl Module for Generating HTML Calendars

SYNOPSIS
========

     use HTML::CalendarMonthSimple;
     $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple('year'=>2001,'month'=>2);
     $cal->width('50%');
     $cal->border(10);
     $cal->header('Text at the top of the Grid');
     $cal->setcontent(14,"Valentine's Day");
     $cal->setdatehref(14, 'http://www.lovers.com/');
     $cal->addcontent(20,"Twentieth day of the month");
     $cal->addcontent(14,"<p>Don't forget to buy flowers.");
     print $cal->as_HTML;

DESCRIPTION
===========

   HTML::CalendarMonthSimple is a Perl module for generating,
manipulating, and printing a HTML calendar grid for a specified month. It
is intended as a faster and easier-to-use alternative to
HTML::CalendarMonth.

   This module requires the Date::Calc module, which is available from
CPAN if you don't already have it.

INTERFACE METHODS
=================

new(ARGUMENTS)
==============

   Naturally, new() returns a newly constructed calendar object.
Recognized arguments are 'year' and 'month', to specify which month's
calendar will be used. If either is omitted, the current value is used. An
important note is that the month and the year are NOT the standard C or
Perl - use a month in the range 1-12 and a real year, e.g. 2001.

     # Examples:
     # Create a calendar for this month.
     $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple();
     # One for a specific month/year
     $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple('month'=>2,'year=>2000);
     # One for "the current date" in 1997
     $cal = new HTML::CalendarMonthSimple('year'=>1997);

setcontent(DATE,STRING)
=======================

addcontent(DATE,STRING)
=======================

getcontent(DATE)
================

   These methods are used to control the content of date cells within the
calendar grid.

     # Examples:
     # The cell for the 15th of the month will now say something.
     $cal->setcontent(15,"An Important Event!");
     # Later down the program, we want the content to be boldfaced.
     $foo = "<b>" . $cal->getcontent(15) . "</b>";
     $cal->setcontent(15,$foo);
     # Or we could get extra spiffy:
     $cal->setcontent(15,"<b>" . $cal->getcontent(15) . "</b>");

     # Example:
     # addcontent() does not clober existing content.
     # Also, if you setcontent() to '', you've deleted the content.
     $cal->setcontent(16,'');
     $cal->addcontent(16,"<p>Hello World</p>");
     $cal->addcontent(16,"<p>Hello Again</p>");
     print $cal->getcontent(16); # Prints 2 sentences

setdatehref(DATE,URL_STRING)
============================

getdatehref(DATE)
=================

   These methods are used to control the content of date cells within the
calendar grid.

     # Example:
     # The date number in the cell for the 15th of the month will
     # be a link to the sourceforge website
     $cal->setdatehref(15,"http://sourceforge.net/");

     # Example:
     # You want to add to an URL
     $cal->setdatehref(15, $getdatehref(15)."projects/perl/");

as_HTML()
=========

   This method returns a string containing the HTML table for the month.

     # Example:
     print $cal->as_HTML();

   It's okay to continue modifying the calendar after calling as_HTML().
My guess is that you'd want to call as_HTML() again to print the
further-modified calendar, but that's your business...

year()
======

month()
=======

monthname()
===========

   These methods simply return the year/month of the calendar. monthname()
returns the text name of the month, e.g. "December".

border([INTEGER])
=================

   This specifies the value of the border attribute to the <TABLE>
declaration for the calendar. As such, this controls the thickness of the
border around the calendar table. The default value is 5.

   If a value is not specified, the current value is returned. If a value
is specified, the border value is changed and the new value is returned.

width([INTEGER][%])
===================

   This sets the value of the width attribute to the <TABLE> declaration
for the calendar. As such, this controls the horizintal width of the
calendar.

   The width value can be either an integer (e.g. 600) or a percentage
string (e.g. "80%"). Most web browsers take an integer to be the table's
width in pixels and a percentage to be the table width relative to the
screen's width. The default width is "100%".

   If a value is not specified, the current value is returned. If a value
is specified, the border value is changed and the new value is returned.

     # Examples:
     $cal->width(600);    # absolute pixel width
     $cal->width("100%"); # percentage of screen size

showdatenumbers([1 or 0])
=========================

   If showdatenumbers() is set to 1, then the as_HTML() method will put
date labels in each cell (e.g. a 1 on the 1st, a 2 on the 2nd, etc.) If
set to 0, then the date labels will not be printed. The default is 1.

   If no value is specified, the current value is returned.

   The date numbers are shown in boldface, normal size font. If you want
to change this, consider setting showdatenumbers() to 0 and using
setcontent()/addcontent() instead.

showweekdayheaders([1 or 0])
============================

   If showweekdayheaders() is set to 1 (the default) then calendars
rendered via as_HTML() will display the names of the days of the week. If
set to 0, the days' names will not be displayed.

   If no value is specified, the current value is returned.

cellalignment([STRING])
=======================

   This sets the value of the align attribute to the <TD> tag for each
day's cell. This controls how text will be centered/aligned within the
cells.

   Any value can be used, if you think the web browser will find it
interesting. Some useful alignments are: left, right, center, top, and
bottom,

   By default, cells are aligned to the left.

header([STRING])
================

   By default, the current month and year are displayed at the top of the
calendar grid. This is called the "header".

   The header() method allows you to set the header to whatever you like.
If no new header is specified, the current header is returned.

   If the header is set to an empty string, then no header will be printed
at all. (No, you won't be stuck with a big empty cell!)

     # Example:
     # Set the month/year header to something snazzy.
     my($y,$m) = ( $cal->year() , $cal->monthname() );
     $cal->header("<center><font size=+2 color=red>$m $y</font></center>\n\n");

BUGS, TODO, CHANGES
===================

   It would be nice if the week didn't have to start on Sunday. It would
also be cool if the weekday headers could be changed (Lunes, Martes,
Miercoles,...)  or suppressed. It'd be nice if the month could be
translated, as well. These features will probably make in into the next
version some time in mid-February.

   Changes in 1.01: Added VALIGN to cells, to make alignment work with
browsers better. Added showweekdayheaders(). Corrected a bug that results
in the month not fitting on the grid (e.g. March 2003).  Added
getdatehref() and setdatehref(). Corrected a bug that causes a blank week
to be printed at the beginning of some months.

1.3.1 (RELEASE)   13 Feb. 2001
==============================

     - Added new Introduction to EmbperlObject written by
       Neil Gunton. See perldoc IntroEmbperlObject
     - Added new Tips and Tricks pod written by
       Neil Gunton. See perldoc TipsAndTricks. Anybody is invited
       to send me their own Tips and Tricks!
     - Added object and isa parameters to Execute, which allows to get an
       object reference for a certain file and set the Perl inherence
       hierachive. Ideas from Neil Gunton and Angus Lees.
     - Corrected a problem that leads to very strange errors when an
       Embperl sub is called from an in memory source (that is passed
       via the Execute input parameter). Spotted by Neil Gunton.
     - Make EmbperlObject work better with relative paths and drive letters
       on Windows. Based on a patch from Freddy Vulto.
     - Fixed a problem with the cache key, which could cause that the same
       file is compiled within different packages.
     - Fixed a problem that Embperl are in a wired state after an file upload
       has been interrupted. Spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck.
     - Fixed a problem set @ISA is not correctly setup in case a file is
       compiled in the same package as the base file of EmbperlObject.
       Spotted by Neil Gunton.
     - Fixed problem with including ../foo.html in EmbperlObject. Spotted
       by Neil Gunton.
     - Added warning if @ISA is not correctly setup/corrupted.
     - Fixed a SIGSEGV that occurs when an reference to undef is returned
       from a [+ +] inside a URL.
     - Added warning to Makefile.PL, if File::Spec 0.82 isn't installed, which is
       required by EmbperlObject.
     - Fixed "use of undefined value" warning in make test

1.3.0 (RELEASE)   4 Dec. 2000
=============================

     - Corrected a wrong test, that let make test fail. Spotted by Eddie Lau.
     - Added a Line Feed at the end of epnames.h, which has caused some problems
       with on old SunOS compiler. Spotted by Roman Maeder.
     - Fixed a problem that Perl generated an error when $req_rec and [$ var $] was
       used. Spotted by Michael Stevens.

1.3b7 (BETA)   15. Nov 2000
===========================

     - Fixed problem that the call to close triggers error in Session.pm when using
       Store::File. Spotted by Alvar Freude.
     - Fixed problem that GetSession doesn't return a value for new session.
       Spotted by Angus Lees.
     - Added new function SetSessionCookie, which can be used to set the session cookie
       header in case you use Embperl session management, but don't use a
       Embperl page in that request. Suggested by Alex Schmelkin.
     - Fixed problem that DeleteSession does not work outside the base template, when
       used with EmbperlObject. Spotted by Angus Lees.
     - Fixed problem when use multiple nested ../foo.htm inside EmbperlObject.
       Spotted by Neil Gunton.
     - Included patch from Angus Lees to ease building on debian.
     - make test now works again with BEN-SSL httpsd. With help from Neil Gunton.
     - Included grammaticaly updated Embperl.pod. Many thanks to Ilia Lobsanov
       for doing the proof reading.
     - removed dbgDisableCache to avoid problems with this "feature" that isn't working
       anymore for a long time.
     - Added validaten for session cookie. If Apache::Session 1.53+ is installed
       it uses the validate method from Apache::Session::Generate::xxx. If a invalid
       session id is found a new one is generated. Spotted by Angus Lees.
     - If a not existing session id is received, Embperl generates now a new one.
     - Enhancements of Cookie resending logic. To make sure cookies are send when
       neccessary, but not more often. (Handles now write to session data, after
       a delete in the same request correctly).
     - Added more tests for Sessionhandling.
     - Fixed a bug that Content-Lenght was 2 to much, when escmode was set to zero.
       Spotted by Michael Smith.
     - Added patches from Randy Korbes for ActiveState Support. Most tests with
       Embperl under mod_perl nows passes. The few remaining ones that doesn't pass
       seems to be due to problems of mod_perl's enironment handling.
     - Droped support for Apache::Session 0.17. Embperl now support only
       Apache::Session 1.00 and higher.
     - Added new option: optDisableSelectScan, to allow processing of SELECT tags,
       while processing of TABLE tags is disabled. Suggested by Robert.
     - Carridge Returns are only removed for Perl 5.004. This makes using of
       HERE documents possible on Perl 5.005+, even if the documents has CRLF
       as lineendings.

1.3b6 (BETA)  18. Oct 2000
==========================

     - Embperl now runs on ActiveState Perl. (At least in offline mode,
       mod_perl mode seems to still have some problems). With a lot of help
       from Randy Korbes.
     - Changed EmbperlObject search order:
       * If EMBPERL_OBJECT_STOPDIR is set, this directory is taken as
         the last directory in the normal search path, instead of the
         directory where the base template (EMBPERL_OBJECT_BASE) is found.
       * EMBPERL_OBJECT_ADDPATH is _always_ added to the search path
       * Now Embperl also searches the path for files like
         ../foo.html, or bar/foo.html, which includes a relative path.
     - ../* is now a shortcut for the requested file, but in the
       parent directory (or upper depending on the search path)
     - Added access to Embperl session handling for modules and
       calling scripts (see SetupSession and GetSession)
     - Embperl is now able to output binary data if EMBPERL_ESCMODE
       and/or $escmode is zero. This also include that no CRLF is
       added at the end of the file, if escmode is zero.
     - Added method for deleting session data and cookie
     - Added method for triggering resend of session cookie.
     - Added Test for pnotes ('EMBPERL_ERRORS')
     - Added hash %CLEANUPFILE. All variables defined into the files given
       in this hash, are also cleanup at the end of the request.
       Patch from Todd Eigenschink.
     - Changed the way the C Requestobject is attached to the Perlobject,
       so it should now also work on 64Bit Processor like Alpha.
       Spotted by Andre Landwehr.
     - Fixed a problem with importing files that contains foreach and
       do until loops, which may caused a syntax error or endless
       loop. Spotted by Steffen Geschke.
     - embpcgi* and embpexec* are now geratated out of *.templ instead
       of editied in place to avoid problems with cvs conflicts
       and lower/uppercase on Win32. Suggest by Jens-Uwe Mager.
     - make test works with Apache that has mod_jserv compiled in
     - Embperl now cache same files with relative path, which are located
       in different directories correctly.

1.3b5 (BETA)  20. Aug 2000
==========================

     - Embperl now supports Apache::Session 1.52. See "Session handling"
       in the docs, how the setup has changed.
     - Fixed a problem with POSTed data, which had got lost for the first,
       request when using EmbperlObject handler. Spotted by
       Kaare Rasmussen.
     - Fixed a typo in HTML::Embperl::Mail, spotted by Robert.
     - changed require to use HTML::Embperl in EmbperlObject to avoid problems
       with dynamic loading. Spotted by Robert.
     - Embperl takes the cookie for session handling from the Apache
       request record to make it available in earlier phases then the
       content handler. Suggested by Jack Cushman.
     - added entity decoding for value attribute of radio/checkboxes.
       Spotted by Chris Thorman.
     - %fdat is not resetup when already done and formtype is
       multipart/formdata. Spotted by Michael Slade.
     - Embperl inserts &amp; instead of a signle & inside query strings
       when expaned from array or hash refs.
     - Embperl now also accepts hashref inside a url and expand it
       to a query_string i.e. <a href="foo.html?[+ { a=>1, b=>2 }+]"> will become
       <a href="foo.html?a=1&amp;b=>2">.
     - EMBPERL_COOKIE_EXPIRES now also supports relativ times like:
       +30s +10m +1h -1d +3M +10y
     - $req_rec -> pnotes ('EMBPERL_ERRORS') could be used to retrieve
       error message inside a error document
     - make Embperl compile and run with threaded Perl 5.6. With help
       from Jason Bodnar. NOTE: That doesn't mean that Embperl is
       threadsafe!

1.3b4 (BETA)  17.07.2000
========================

     - New $escmode (or EMBPERL_ESCMODE) to disable the possiblilty
       to turn off escaping with a leading backslash. Adding 4 to
       any escmode will cause Embperl to do no special processing
       on the backslash. This is mainly to avoid problems with
       cross site scripting issuse, where people are able to enter
       aribtary HTML. Spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck.
     - Characters between 128 and 159 are all HTML escaped now to
       avoid problems with buggy browser, which were reported to
       treat the chars 139 and 141 as < and >.  Spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck.
     - If a requested file is not found when using EmbperlObject as handler,
       the file given by C<EMBPERL_OBJECT_FALLBACK> is displayed instead.
       If C<EMBPERL_OBJECT_FALLBACK> isn't set a staus 404, NOT_FOUND is
       returned as usual.
     - "perl Makefile.PL debug" will build debugging information for
       gdb/ms-vc++ into Embperl library.
     - test.pl can take a bunch of new options for debugging Embperl itself.
       See make test TESTARGS="--help".
     - Embperl 1.x and 2.x share now the same Makefile.PL and test.pl
     - Added new debug flag dbgObjectSerach which logs the EmbperlObjects
       work when searching the correct file.
     - If import parameter is given to Execute, Perl code is compiled, but
       only [!  !] blocks are executed (to allow sub definitions on import)
     - Space is converted to %20 instead of +, because that is more generic.
       Suggested by Michael Blakely.
     - EmbperlObject now automaticly defines all subs that are declared
       inside the base template and inside the requested page, so it isn't
       neccessary anymore to call Execute with import => 0 for them.
     - Every Embperl Page now get passed a request object (which can be obtained
       from $_[0]). The request object is a hash reference which is blessed
       into the package HTML::Embperl::Req. Embperl itself don't uses the hash, so
       you are free to populate it and pass data between different pages of one request.
     - EmbperlObject now setup the inherence so that
         request page -ISA->
         base template -ISA->
         EMBPERL_OBJECT_HANDLER_CLASS (if defined) -ISA->
         HTML::Embperl::Req
       and the Embperl request object is blessed into the packages of the
       requested page, so you can do methods calls to subs that are defined
       inside the requested page.
     - correct spelling error and renamed ScanEnvironement to ScanEnvironment.
       (ScanEnvironement still works).
     - EmbperlObject can now be used also offline (via HTML::EmbperlObject::Execute)
     - MailFormTo and HTML::Embperl::Mail::Execute now have a configuration
       directive EMBPERL_MAILHELO, can be used to specify the host/domain for the
       HELO/EHLO command. Suggested by Remco Brink.
     - Fixed a bug that caused the default drive to be incorrectly set on Win 32.


1.3b3 (BETA)  25.04.2000
========================

     - Fixed SIGSEGV which occurs in cleanup with Perl 5.6. Spotted by
       Aaron Johnson.
     - Changed make test so it works correctly with new error messages of
       Perl 5.6.
     - Fixed a bug that Execute will always fail when $@ was set before.
       Patch from Francis J. Lacoste.
     - Changed test so it accpects charset in Content-Type header from
       Apache 1.3.12
     - The outputfile parameter now also works when running under
       mod_perl. Spotted by Ilia Lobsanov.
     - Makefile.PL warns if you build with a DSO mod_perl < 1.22
     - make test checks that test files are readable by Apache.
     - Applied a patch from Jens-Uwe Magner to make Embperl work
       with mod_perl 1.22 on AIX. We now require mod_perl 1.22,
       but I should now work as DSO and staticly linked.
     - Applied a patch from Francis J. Lacoste that makes sure
       that when a package name is given the file is always compiled
       into this package. Note: This means that if you specify a
       packagename and the packagename differs from request to
       request, the page is compiled for every package and therfore
       consuming memory on every request.
     - Added EMBPERL_SESSION_HANDLER_CLASS which allows you to overwrite
       Embperl defaults session handling. Idea form Barrie Slaymaker.
     - Added EmbperlLogo.gif to the distribution, which contains
       "Powered by Embperl".
     - Added Patch from Randy Kobes that makes Embperl compile with
       Apache 1.3.12 and Perl 5.6 on Win32.
     - Removed some -w warnings form EmbperlObject
     - Added tests for EmbperlObject
     - Fixed a SIGSEGV that occured when Embperl found [*] inside
       a page. Spotted by Barrie Slaymaker.
     - Added epchar.c.min which contains translation tables which
       let's all chars above 128 untouched. This is usefull for
       processing two byte charsets. Patch from Sangmook Yi.
     - The searchpath (EMBPERL_PATH) now uses semikolons (';') instead
       of colons (':') to avoid problems with Windows drive letters.
       Colons still work on Unix.

1.3b2 (BETA) 11. Feb 2000
=========================

     - added new mod_perl handler EmbperlObject, which helps to build whole
       pages out of small objects, which can be overwritten in "derived"
       pages.
       EmbperlObject allows you to define the standard layout of your site just
       once and includes the neccessary components based on the uri. Your HTML
       documents just have to contain the unique stuff and not the common stuff
       like headers/footers or navigation bars. Also these common elements can
       be overwritten in each subdirectory.
     - added EMBPERL_PATH (and path parameter to Execute), which can contain
       a colon separated search path. Embperl uses it when a file, which does
       not contain a path, is executed.
     - added new module HTML::Embperl::Mail which sends a file processed via
       Embperl by email.
     - Fixed a bug, that the logfile if opened also EMBPERL_DEBUG is set
       to zero. Now if debug is zero, no logfile will be opened. Spotted
       by Jason Bodnar and Christian Gilmore.

1.2.1  5. Jan 2000
==================

     - fdat parameter of Execute function isn´t honoured when
       call from CGI script which has received multipart/formdata.
       Spotted by NHan H. Trinh.
     - @ffld was not correctly setup, when only fdat parameter is
       given in calls to Execute.
     - if mtime parameter is undef or 0, now the pcode really isn't
       cached. Spotted by Neeme Vool.
     - EMBPERL_OPTIONS and EMBPERL_DEBUG (debug, options) accepts
       now decimal, binary, octal and hex values.
     - fix a SIGSEGV that could occur under rare conditions in
       cleanup. With help from Todd Eigenschink and Gary Shea.
     - fix a problem that $req_rec is not correctly setup inside
       imported subs. Reported by Cliff Rayman.
     - specify domain/hostname when sending mail via MailFormTo
     - add EMBPERL_MAILFROM config, to make sender used by
       MailFormTo configurable
     - add EMBPERL_MAILDEBUG config, to allow debugging of email
       problems in MailFormTo
     - ProxyInput now handles posted form data. Spotted by
       Neeme Vool.
     - EMBPERL_INPUT_FUNC now allows to also give the name
       under which the source should cached, to allow correct
       cacheing of data read via EMBPERL_INPUT_FUNC. Spotted by
       Neeme Vool.
     - Fixed a SIGSEGV in OPTION tag which occurs due to
       different integer sizes on 64Bit systems. With help
       from David Waldo.

1.2.0  17 Nov 1999
==================

     - test script had failed in cgi mode on win32. Spotted by
       Randy Korbes.

1.2b11 (BETA)  4 Nov 1999
=========================

     - Added the "Status:" header and error message to embpcgi.pl to
       let Apache return the correct status line. Patch from Jason Holt.
     - Fixed problem that Apache SIGSEGVs when an error message contains
       a %x. Spotted by Ed Park.
     - Added missing BEGIN block in docs for Session handling.
     - Fixed an endless loop that occured when tainting is on and
       the same document is called two times via Execute. With help
       from Jason Holt.
     - Changed access to addtional upload fileinfo. The old syntax
       (${${$fdat{<name_of_field>}}}) isn't available anymore, because
       it doesn't work with filenames that are not a vaild perl
       variable name. Now there is a second field which start with a
       dash that's holds a hash ref to the file info. Spotted by
       Huang-Ming Pan.
     - The Embperl specific part of Apache session (former
       Apache::Session::Embperl) is now part of the Embperl distribution
       (as HTML::Embperl::Session). This makes Embperl independ of
       new releases of Apache::Session. Embperl now works with
       Apache::Session version 1.00 and higher. Apache::Session 0.17 is still
       supported, but the documentation is removed, because it should no
       longer be used.
     - Apache::Session must not be preloaded prior to Embperl. It's
       enought to set EMBPERL_SESSION_CLASSES and Embperl will bring
       the right modules in memory for you.
     - Removed the call to mod_perl_sent_header, which was an workaround
       for an problem with (very) old mod_perl version, because it doesn't
       resolve on (every) IRIX. Spotted by Jearanai Vongsaard.
     - NOT_FOUND, FORBIDDEN now also logged thru Apache, so the LogLevel is
       honoured and log message in Apache error log get a time stamp.
       Spotted by Christian Gilmore.
     - Removed warings that apears when compiling with -Wall.
     - Added URL of better emacs mode for Embperl from Erik Arneson.
     - Added new paramter 'errors' to Execute function which takes an
       array ref, that returns any error messages. Suggested by
       James Elson.
     - Fixed that serveral options where not settable inside an Embperl page.
       Spotted by Ilya Ketris.

1.2b10 (BETA) 7 Oct. 1999
=========================

     - Fixed a great security whole in CGI mode. Because Apache passes
       anything after the first '?' to the cgi script as commandline
       arguments, embpexec.pl could be tricked into offline mode, where
       it returned any file that is readable by the httpd! So if you are
       using CGI mode, I strongly recommend to update to 1.2b10.
       Now you must use embpcgi.pl instead of embpexec.pl in CGI mode.
       Spotted by Jason Holt.
     - Added EMBPERL_ALLOW. If the file doesn't EMBPERL_ALLOW Embperl
       will return forbidden. This is primarly another security
       feature, because dependig on the way you use Embperl in CGI mode,
       it will not honour all Apache access restrictions. With
       EMBPERL_ALLOW, you can now force it to serve only certain
       files. Suggested by Jason Holt.
     - Fixed a problem that had occured with magic SVs (tied scalar)
       as source for the Execute function. Spotted by Todd Eigenschink.
     - Embperl works now with Apache::Session 0.17, 1.02 and 1.04
       (1.03 is errornous)
     - Fixed a SIGSEGV that occurs when the req_rec parameter of the
       Execute functions gets a Apache::Request object instead of a
       Apache object, which occured due to the different ways the
       Apache internal request_rec is stored inside the object.
       Spotted by Francis J. Lacoste.
     - Fixed a SIGSEGV that occured when outputting to a scalar and
       optReturnError is set. Spotted by Francis J. Lacoste.
     - Added a ; after the begin block in startup.pl, which seems had
       cause a syntax error in some situations. Spotted by Oyvind Gjerstad.
     - exit now works the same in offline, mod_perl and cgi mode, it
       ends the execution of the page, but not the programm itself.
     - exit inside a sub will now really exit the page. (but exit inside
       a file called via Execute will only exit this file, not the whole
       request) Spotted by Cliff Rayman.
     - Added new hash %http_headers_out which could be used to set arbitary
       http header under mod_perl _and_ in cgi mode. "Location" header will
       automaticly set status to 301.
     - setting http headers and <META HTTP-EQUIV=..> now works also
       in cgi mode.
     - Session Handling now also works in CGI mode (needs
       Apache::Session >= 1.04)
     - ACTION attribute of Formtag is now URL en/decoded. Spotted by
       Hartmut Palm.

1.2b9 (BETA) 10. Sept 1999
==========================

     - Fixed a problem with loading Apache::Session 1.01, when
       Apache::Session 0.17 is not installed. Spotted by Volker Hess.

1.2b8 (BETA) 9. Sept 1999
=========================

     - Fixed behaviour of <INPUT>. <INPUT> now does not overide
       VALUE="" with the value from %fdat. This seems to has been
       broken, since a couple of versions and the fix may break
       pages that depends on that wrong behaviour. Anyway I have
       to fix it before the release version is out!
     - Added a patch (and a FAQ) from Jens-Uwe Mager, so Embperl compiles
       and links on AIX.
     - Fixed error in URL unescaping, spotted by Hartmut Palm.
     - _WINSOCK2API_ gets defined on Win32, when compiling with
       Apache 1.3.9. Spotted by Randy Korbes.
     - Win32 test uses also embpexec.test.pl (instead of .bat),
       so cgi test runs also with Apache 1.3.9. Spotted by Randy Korbes.
     - Fixed problem with EMBPERL_SESSION_ARGS that splits the arguments
       wrong when, for example, the DataSource contains a '='. Spotted by
       Vince Galloway.
     - Fix a memory leak which eats one SV per <OPTION> tag, introduced
       in 1.2b6.
     - Fix a problem that meta commands also recognized as html tags, i.e.
       now <if x> is no longer the same as [$ if x $]. Spotted by Danielle Gallo.
     - German documentation (IntroD.pod, FeaturesD.pod and EmbperlD.pod)
       are now included in the distribution.

1.2b7 (BETA) 30 Aug 1999
========================

     - Embperl works now with Apache::Session 1.01
       (1.01 _not_ 1.00 or below!)
     - Cookie for session id is only send the first time and not
       resend if it's already known by the browser. Suggested
       by Roman Maeder.
     - Fixed a SIGSEGV that occurs with $optRawInput = 1 and a
       value is in %fdat, but not in the input html tag. Spotted
       by Robert.

1.2b6 (BETA) 19 Aug 1999
========================

     - When call another page via Execute EMBPERL_VIRTLOG will
       automaticly set to the same value as the in the calling page
     - Add parameter 'firstline' to specify the linenumber of the
       first line in the input
     - Defined missing DECLINED constant for non mod_perl environement
       Spotted by James Elson.
     - Inside of an A tag URL escaped characters are translated back
       to their ascii aquivalent inside of perl code, before the code
       is executed. This avoid problems with HTML editors, which
       changes space to %20 inside an URL.
     - '%' is escaped to %25 inside of URLs
     - Inside the A tag only the HREF attribute is URL escaped, instead
       of the whole tag.
     - The SRC attribute of embed, frame, iframe, img, layer now are
       also URL escaped.
     - Giving a an array refernce inside an URL, cause Embperl expand
       it to URL parameter syntax (i.e. [+ \@A +] becomes A=1&B=2, when
       @A = (A, 1, B, 2) ).
     - Embperl checks now for unclosed metacommands (if, while etc.) and
       unclosed HTML tags (table etc.). Suggest by Todd Eigenschink.
     - Fixed a problem when file was not found, which causes in some cases
       a SIGSEGV.
     - Added new configuration directive EMBPERL_MAIL_ERRORS_TO. If set
       all error messages will be send to the given address.
     - input_/output_func parameter can take a code reference as
       argument. Based on a patch from Jon Tobey.
     - Set force PERL_DL_NONLAZY to zero, so make test does not fail
       if dynaloader was initialized with PERL_DL_NONLAZY set.
       Patch from John Tobey.
     - [$ foreach $i(x..y) $] does not require a space before the (
       anymore. Suggested by Jonny Cavell.
     - select <option value="a &amp; b"> works now correctly. Spotted by
       Rick Welykochy.
     - Fixed SegFault when parameter input => is numeric. Spotted by
       Cliff Rayman.
     - Added option optNoUncloseWarn, which disables the warnings
       about unclosed if, while, table etc.

1.2b5 (BETA)  5 July 1999
=========================

     - Renamed __strdup and __strndup so there are no duplicate
       symbols when compiling with glibc. Spotted by Michael Hall.
     - Removed some debugging message from the logfile output.
     - Correct some wrong table entries for html escaping of some
       characters like §
     - Added optReturnError which causes Embperl to return an
       error code and let the calling programm (i.e. Apache)
       handle the error. This is necessary to use the
       ErrorDocument directive together with Embperl. Spotted by
       Michael Smith.
     - Fixed the problem that the output of Execute inside a table
       didn't come out when optEarlyHttpHeader was set. Spotted by
       Chris Alexander.
     - %fdat of a Execute will not be overwritten anymore when the
       %fdat of the main request was empty. Spotted by Chris Alexander.
     - fixed a small memory leak which was caused by not releasing
       memory space for the cookie-name/-domain etc.
     - added the missing -T switch to embpexec.test.bat, which caused the
       taint test in cgi mode to fail on win32
     - Added epchar.c.iso-latin-2 from Jiri Novak, which contains the correct
       escaping for the iso-8859-2 (iso-latin-2) character set. You may use it
       to replace the standard epchar.c
     - Added new metacommand [$ sub <name> $] and [$ endsub $] which allows
       you to define blocks of code an call them mulitple times inside a page,
       either a creating a subrequest Execute('#<name>') or by calling them
       directly as a perl subroutine [- <name> -]. Read the docs for more
       information on the details and differences.
     - Added new parameter "import" to Execute, which let's you import subs
       (defined with [$sub <name>$]) into the current page.
     - @ffld is filled with 'values %fdat' if the ffld parameter in the call
       to the Execute funtion is missing.
     - Filedata will held into memory until the end of the request, so a
       second call to Execute for the same file will not reread the data
       from disk.
     - Added emacs/embperl.el. It's a emacs minor mode for Embperl written
       by Erik Arneson
     - Output of dbgShowCleanup is now sorted by name
     - Update the Faq.pod with new Q&A and removed obsolete Q&A
     - Made Makefile.PL more smarter in DSO situations. It detecteds now
       which of the needed Apache modules are linked staticly and places
       neccessary LoadModule statements in the httpd.conf for make test.
       This way make test should work also where all modules linked at
       runtime, like on RedHat 6. With help form James H. Thompson.
     - Makefile.PL ask´s now if it can´t find any modules. On win32
       it will not try to guess (the maybe wrong) path anymore.
     - Added possibility to get the the uploadInfo from CGI.pm
       (e.g. ${${$fdat{upload}}} -> {'Content-Type'} will return the
        content type). Requested by Brian Reichert.
     - Catch die of CGI.pm when it hit's a 'Malformed multipart POST'.
       Spooted by Chris Alexander.
     - Add optKeepSrcInMemory which tells Embperl to keep the source
       file in memory and not reload it on every request
     - Added the possibility to use recursive calls to Execute.
       NOTE: You can create local variables via [* local $foo ; *]
     - Reworked the cleanup. Now imported values from other modules
       left unchanged. This solves problems with using modules
       inside Embperl pages, which exports some global variables.
     - Added the %CLEANUP hash. Put variables into with should be
       additional cleaned up ($CLEANUP{'var'} = 1) or which shouldn't
       cleaned up ($CLEANUP{'var'} = 0)
     - Special handling for DBIx::Recordset objects, so it's sure
       they are really get destroyed
     - fixed a problem with dynamic tables, that occurs when you
       had tried to repeat multiple table rows
     - Embperl compiles now with perl5.005_57+. Patch from Ask Bjoern Hansen
     - Cleanup now logs any errors that occurs when calling object
       destructors and makes sure errors inside object destructors do
       not break Embperl itself.
     - Embperl now returns DECLINED when called for a directory. This
       way Apache can handle diretories the correct way. This will make
       DiretoryIndex (e.g. index.html) work again with Embperl.
     - Fixed a problem that @ffld contains the same field more then
       one time if posted from a select multiple with multiple items
       selected. This caused problems with [$hidden$]. Spotted by
       Martin Leja.
     - Double quotes (") will be url-encoded to %22 inside URLs.
     - Embperl now never writes to the logfile if EMBPERL_DEBUG is zero
     - make test now runs with newest version of mod_ssl (2.3.5)
     - Added option optKeepSpaces which will disable the removing of spaces
       and empty lines from the output. Suggested from Gary Shea.
     - Added option optOpenLogEarly, which will cause Embperl to open the
       logfile as soon as it is loaded into memory. You can use this when
       you loaded Embperl via PerlModule under Apache, to open the log
       as root instead of the non-privileged user Apache runs as.

1.2b4 (BETA)  15 Feb 1999
=========================

     - fixed a problem that $req_rec was sometimes invalid on the
       second call to the same page causing Embperl to SIGSEGV.
       With help of Todd Eigenschink.
     - Cleanup the variable space inside Embperl pages. Before this
       fix many of the internal my variables were visible to the
       Embperl page. Spotted by Todd Eigenschink.
     - multiple form values with the same name are handled now
       correctly (concated in a tab delimited string) when send
       in a multipart/form-data (file-upload). Spotted by Dirk
       Lutzebaeck.
     - The dbgForm flag works now also for multipart/form-data
     - a missing right *] will be reported as an error.
     - [[* is correctly output as [* and not interpreted as a
       starting of a perl block. Spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck.
     - fixed a bug that causes the html after an endforeach to be
       skiped, when the foreach loop gets an empty array as argument.
       Spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck.
     - Makefile.PL checks now for required modules and versions and
       generates warnings if necessary
     - Do not CLEAR %udat and %mdat in cleanup, so Apache::Session
       will not warn anymore about unsupported CLEAR operation.
     - Added tests for session management (%udat, %mdat)
     - Added more tests to see that $req_rec is correctly setup
     - Added module Apache::Session::epDBI which is a subclass of
       Apache::Session::DBI and corrects a problem with locking and
       cares of serializing requests, so %mdat works correctly.
       Please read IMPORTANT NOTE under Session Management in
       Embperl.pod
     - Added the dbgProfile flag which cause the display of the time
       since the request start for every source line in the logfile.
     - Correct a problem that the escape character ('\') was not removed
       when unescaping the input. Now '&lt;' is correctly translated
       to '<'  and '\&lt;' is translated to '&lt;' .
     - When requesting to view the logfile via the browser now all
       lines which does not start with a pid ([<pid>]) are displayed.
     - fixed a problem, that sometimes not all errors are shown in the
       error page, in conjunction with dynamic tables
     - When running under perl 5.005 or higher, the cleanup after the
       every request, now not only cleans up scalars, array and hashs,
       but also closes all open file- and directoryhandles and undef's
       all typglob (which causes for example DBIx::Recordset objects to
       DESTROY correctly)
       NOTE: This also causes imported variables from other packages/modules
       not to be cleanedup anymore!!
       NOTE: That the cleanup behaveiour under perl 5.004 and 5.005 is
       slightly differnt! The new cleanup doesn't work with 5.004 because
       of a bug, which should be corrected in 5.004_05 as soon as available.
     - EMail adress from the form is insert as Reply-To header instead of
       From header in MailFormTo to avoid problems with unresolvable
       EMail adresses.
     - Fixed the problem that session management (%udat, %mdat) didn't
       work when Execute is used in the same page. Spotted by by Simon Lindgren.
     - Fixed a path problem in Makefile.PL. Now pathes on Win32 Systems uses
       blackslash instead of slash. Spotted by Randy Kobes.
     - Win32 batch files will no longer contain path to perl after the #!,
       so cgi tests passes on systems with 4DOS shell. Spotted by Randy Kobes.
     - Added ; as terminator for cookie to correctly parse multiple cookies.
       Patch from Tim Carrol.
     - Changed table_set to table_add when setting the cookie for session data
       to avoid problems with other modules setting also cookies.
     - Corrected the %ENV problem that mod_perl-1.18 introduced, so both
       work together again.
     - Added dbgSession flag to enable/disable logging of session handling
     - Added configuration diretives EMBPERL_COOKIE_NAME, EMBPERL_COOKIE_DOMAIN,
       EMBPERL_COOKIE_PATH and EMBPERL_COOKIE_EXPIRES to configure the cookie
       which holds the session id. Suggested by Cliff Rayman.

1.2b3 (BETA)  22 Nov 1998
=========================

     - fixed an undefined pointer which occurs when using precompiled
       [* ... *] blocks. Spotted by Bruce W. Holyman and Paul J. Schinder
     - removed unwanted 0xa0 characters from tagscan.htm which causes
       the test to fail on sunos. Spotted by Paul J. Schnider.
     - Enhanced the detection of Stronghold, Apache SSL and mod_ssl
       so they are found if they are not in a standard path. Spotted
       by Brad Cox.
     - Convert relativ path for apache source to absolute to avoid
       problems within test script. Spotted by Brad Cox.
     - Make Embperl compile with useperio=defined. Spotted by Todd
       Eigenschink.
     - Makefile.PL does now check if mod_perl is compiled into apache
       and don't create a config for USE_DSO situtation even if
       libperl.so exists.
     - Added a workarround in the Execute('foo.htm') call, to avoid a
       bug in perl5.004 which causes a SIGSEGV. Spotted by Michael J.
       Schout and Chris Alexander.

1.2b2 (BETA) 9 Nov 1998
=======================

     - There is now a short form of the Execute function. You can
       now include a sub page in an Embperl page by simply writing
       [- Execute ('filename.html') -] or use
       [- Execute ('filename.html', 1, 2, 3) -] to pass additional
       parameters
     - Added new block [* ... *]. This block compiles code to an
       outer subroutine which surounds the whole page. This makes
       it possible to define "local" variables with a scope of the
       whole page, which would be necessary for recursive calls
       to Execute.
       Also this let you use perl control structures inside Embperl
       pages:  e.g.
           [* foreach $v (1..5) { *] Cnt = [+ $v +] [* } *]
       NOTE: [* ... *] blocks _must_ always end with a ;,{ or }
             [* ... *] cannot apear inside html tags that are
             interpreted by Embperl (unless you disable the
             interpretation of such tags like table, input etc.)
     - Added a comment block: Everything between [# and #] is a
       comment and is removed from the output.
       NOTE: [* ... *] blocks also interpreted inside of a
             [# ... #] block, all other blocks [+/-/$ $/-/+] are not.
     - Added magic hash %mdat, which can be used to store persitent
       data on a per module basis (needs Apache::Session, with
       path in session.patch applied)
     - Done more tests on session handling, seems to work fine now.
     - Added new option dbgNoHiddenEmptyValue which suppresses
       empty hidden input fields in the [$hidden$] meta command.
       Patch from Steve Willer.
     - Whitespaces after [...] blocks are removed in the output, so
       there will be less empty lines, makeing the output shorter and
       more readable, based on a patch from Todd Eigenschink.
     - Embperl compiles now with mod_ssl (from Ralf Engelschall).
       Spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck and Randel Schwartz.
     - Added a patch from Todd Eigenschink to build Embperl with
       Stronghold 2.4.1
     - Added patch from Gerald McLarnon so Embperl compiles on AIX
     - Added optAllowZeroFileSize to accept files of length 0,
       without that option Embperl will report NOT_FOUND.
       Suggested by Doug Bagley

     - fixed a wrong call to logerror when OPT_EXECCGI is not on,
       spotted by Dirk Lutzebaeck.
     - fixed the problem that reloads only takes place at the next day,
       because mtime was an int instead of a double (introduced in1.2b1.
       Spotted by Michael Smith and Roman Maeder.
     - fixed a problem that changing of the filesize was ignored, when
       a documents is reloaded (introducted in 1.2b1)
     - cleanup for all subpages are disabled if main request has
       disabled cleanup and subpages does not specify otherwise
     - dbgShowCleanup works again
     - Every package is only cleanuped once, also it's included multiple
       times in one page
     - %fdat and @ffld are setup correctly when optDisableVarCleanup
       is set
     - DEFS=-DEPDEBUGALL compiles again, spotted by Michael Smith
     - fixed that cleanup is never called with Execute nesting, when
       req_rec was not set. Now the parameter req_rec isn't necessary
       anymore. Spotted by Michael J.Schout
     - Changes of $escmode inside a HTML-A tag now handled correctly,
       spotted by Michael Smith
     - fixed problems with links to the logfile and the line break
       in the html log file display
     - fixed a problem with blocks that expand to nothing inside of Embperl
       interpreted HTML tags.
     - Adapted test script to modified error output of Apache 1.3.4.
       Spotted by Eric Cholet.
     - Empty values (VALUE="") in input tags will not be overridden by
       value in %fdat

1.2b1 (BETA)  8 Oct 1998
========================

     - I have reworked the whole source code so Embperl is now
       going to be an object. This means Embperl is reentrant, you
       can call Execute within an Embperl page, for example to include
       the same header on each page.
     - Addeded Session handling via Apache::Session. Simply store data
       to %udat and let Embperl do the rest for you. Experimental!
       NOTE: You need Apache-Session-0.16.1 or higher and must apply
       the patch from session.patch to it.
     - Added test for calling Execute inside a Embperl page
     - Errors of Input/Output function now also log to the httpd error log
     - Added an test for input file not found

1.1.1  15 Sep 1998
==================

     - A lot of documentation updates. Now Embperl ships with most of
       the documentation which is also available on
             http://perl.apache.org/embperl/
       This includes:
       - Intro.pod  an introduction to Embperl
       - Faq.pod    an new very much extented version of the FAQ
       and a lot of spell checking, gramar checking and so on
       Thanks very much to Nora Mikes for putting together the FAQ
       and doing a lot of proof reading.
     - eg/x/upload.htm an example for file upload within Embperl
     - splited documentation out of Embperl.pm into Embperl.pod
       to make it load a little bit faster (Embperl.pm is now 30K
       instead of 90K)
     - Optimized the loading of other modules. Other modules are now
       only loaded when really necessary. This make Embperl in CGI mode
       about 2 times faster then version 1.1.0 was.
     - Added a test for file-upload
     - Embperl compiles and works now with threaded perl, but Embperl
       is currently B<not> threadsafe. So you can use Embperl in a
       threaded environement, but you have to make sure that only one
       thread useses Embperl at a time.
     - Fixed a memory leak which has occured in checkboxes and selects
     - Enhanced test.pl
     - MailFormTo: Send \n after mail header to work correctly with all
       mail servers, added EMBPERL_MAILHOST to specify mail server hostname,
       MailFormTo dies when it can't connect to mailserver. Spotted by
       Steffen Geschke.

1.1.0  28 Jul 98
================

     - Added support for perl5.005 (currently only without threads!)
     - Nesting of metacommands and HTML tags are now independent of
       each other.
     - Added examples in eg/x for do .. until, foreach, if,
       DBI datbase access, DBIx::Recordset database access and a
       input- / confirmation form.
     - Added optUndefToEmptyValue which will cause Embperl to treat non-
       existent values in %fdat as an empty string in input tags, as suggested
       by Steve Willer.
     - Catch "die" within EMBPERL_INPUT/OUTPUT_FUNC and write error
       message to the logfile
     - Write error message of LWP::UserAgent in ProxyInput to logfile
       if any
     - Added test for POST Requests
     - Added support for tests when mod_perl is built with USE_DSO.
       Spotted by Christian Oyarzun.

     - Selects and checkboxes are setup correctly if state is set via %fdat.
       Spotted by Todd Eigenschink and Steve Willer.
     - Changes URL escaping so that only space, '+', '&', '=' and chars < 0x20
       will be escaped to avoid problems with older netscape browsers.
     - Added missing documentation for req_rec parameter of the Execute
       function. Spotted by Eric Cholet.
     - Send correct http header for error page, spotted by Steve Willer
     - Fixed a memory leak in foreach metacommand
     - Removed limit of 2048 Bytes for GET request data (there is no
       limit anymore). Spotted by Steve Willer
     - Read all POSTed data (not just the first 1024 Bytes). Patch from
       Steve Willer.
     - Removed some compiler warnings spotted by Tarang Kumar Patel
     - Make sure all data is flushed to the logfile at the end of
       each request
     - Fixed a bug that causes Init to set DebugFlags to 1 instead of 0.
       Spotted by Eric Cholet.

1.1b2  27 Jun 98
================

     - Added an additional note for input- and output- escaping
       which is described in "Inside Embperl" section.
       It's very important to understand this if you have any
       problems with HTML tags or filehandles in your Perl code.
     - Embperl will recognize Apache::exit. If called inside an
       Embperl page or in a module called from an Embperl page,
       the processing of the document is immediately aborted.
       Everything processed so far is output/sent to the browser.
       Based on a patch from Steve Willer.
     - When running under mod_perl, 'exit' is an alias for Apache::exit
       in every document.
     - Enhanced the format of the Errorpage. Thanks for the patch
       from Steve Willer
     - Added a [$ foreach $] and a [$ do $] ... [$ until $]
       metacommand

     - Now multiple checkboxes with the same name will be set
       correctly, to the values posted to the document. Spotted
       by Todd Eigenschink and Nathan Krislock.
     - [+ local $escmode = 0 .... +] works now. The first setting
       of $escmode in a [+ ... +] block will now applied to the
       whole block. You cannot change $escmode inside a [+ ... +]
       block. Spotted by Chris Thormann.
     - Fixed the return path setting in MailFormFields
     - ProxyInput now passes http headers, so authentification
       will be passed thru.
     - Removed the limit 2048 for the length of HTML tags when [+ ... +]
       are included. Now there is no limit anymore. Spotted by Doug Bagley

1.1b1  14 Jun 98
================

     - Now you can set custom input and/or output functions via
       EMBPERL_INPUT_FUNC and EMBPERL_OUTPUT_FUNC. This can be
       used to chain modules together or to get the input from
       (or put the output to) non-standard locations.
     - Added a function ProxyInput which can be used to fetch
       the input from another URL instead of the disk. One possible
       usage for this is to let mod_include parse the document first
       and then let Embperl process it. Suggested by Steffen Geschke.
     - Added a function LogOutput, which will write every generated
       document to a unique file in addition to sending it to the
       browser. Suggested by Dan Peterson.
     - EMBPERL_FILESMATCH allows you to select which files in
       a Location should be processed by Embperl. The rest are handled
       by the Apache default handler. This allows you to have
       Embperl and non-Embperl documents (like gifs etc.) in
       the same directory.

     - Logfile was displayed at the wrong position when requested via the
       browser the first time after the httpd was started.

1.0.0  12 Jun 98
================

     - Make test runs with Apache 1.3.0, spotted by Eric Cholet
     - Added a definition for MAX_PATH, which is not there on SunOS 4.1.4.
       Spotted by Dan Peterson
     - Fixed a bug that causes Makefile.PL to interpret MakeMaker parameters
       spotted by Jason Bodnar
     - Fixed a bug that caused EMBPERL_PACKAGE not to be recognized.
     - Fixed a bug that caused optDisableFormData not to be recognized for
       multipart formdata.

0.28-beta 19 May 1998
=====================

     - I have added a chapter "Inside Embperl" to the docs, I hope this
       will make it clearer how escaping and unescaping works and how you
       can get desired results. Highly recommended! (Thanks for spell- and
       grammar-checking to Todd Eigenschink)
     - make test now runs under win32 (You need to install LWP and libwin32)
       IMPORTANT: You need a mod_perl version > 1.11 or you get a deadlock.
     - Compiles with apache_1.3b6
     - Added support for Stronghold and Apache_SSL to Makefile.PL and test.pl
     - Changed dbgEarlyHttpHeader to optEarlyHttpHeader because it's not a
       debugging option. dbgEarlyHttpHeader still persists, but will be removed
       in one of the following versions
     - Embperl does not change the current working directory when optDisableChdir
       is set, this saves some milliseconds per request, also the cwd is moved
       to the c code, so it runs faster then Cwd::fastwd.
       Thanks to Doug Bagley for the profile which has shown how much time
       Cwd::fastcwd consumes
     - You can set optDisableHtmlScan in EMBPERL_OPTIONS. If set, Embperl only
       recongizes [+/-/$/! ... !/$/-/+], but will not do anything with HTML tags,
       as suggested by Randy Harmon.
     - optDisableInputScan, optDisableTableScan and optDisableMetaScan can be
       used to disable only some of the HTML tag processing
     - You can set optDisableFormData in EMBPERL_OPTIONS. If set, Embperl
       will not setup the %fdat and @ffld, as suggested by Doug Bagley
     - If you use Execute, the explicit call to Init/Term isn't needed anymore,
       because Embperl performs the Init automatically when it is loaded. The
       Init function can still be used to change the path of logfile. Suggested
       by Honza Jirousek
     - All options and debugging flags can now be read/set at runtime. For
       example $optRawInput = 1 sets the optRawInputFlag. Some of the options
       are read-only, because they must be known before the request.
     - Added more tests
     - Embperl discards all errors which occur in an expression after the end
       of a dynamic table, and which are only evaluated to detect the table end and
       never displayed. This allows usage of object methods in dynamic tables,
       where the table end is caused by an undefined object. (see
       test/html/object.htm for an example). Spotted by Jason Bodnar.
     - Printing to filehandle OUT has the same effect as using [+ .. +]
       (including html-escaping)
     - Setting optRedirectStdout causes Embperl to tie STDOUT to the Embperl
       output stream (same as print OUT ...), suggested by Jason Bodar
     - Setting optAllFormData will make empty formfields occur in %fdat and @ffld
       with an empty string value, suggested by Dan Peterson

     - Embperl now handles SELECT MULTIPLE correct. All OPTIONs which are
       posted to the document will now be selected by Embperl, spotted by
       Todd Eigenschink
     - Fixed a bug that caused a '>' inside a [$/! ... !/$] block to be
       interpreted as the end of a HTML tag, spotted by Todd Eigenschink.
     - Fixed a bug which caused the SELECT/OPTIONS tag to not insert their
       values in %idat and therefore made [$hidden$] work incorrectly, spotted by
       Dave Paris [aka Spider]
     - Fixed a bug that caused the INPUT CHECKBOX tag to not insert its
       value in %idat when the value wasn't in %fdat and therefore made [$hidden$]
       work incorrectly.
     - Fixed a problem that caused magical variables to be handled as if they
       were undefined, which caused dynamic tables to end, sometimes prematurely.
     - Closing HTML tags will be correctly removed form Perl source again
       (when optRawInput is not set)
     - &nbsp; will be translated to space (0x20) instead of 0xf0
     - When EMBPERL_DEBUG is set 0, only errors and warnings will be written to
       the logfile
     - MailFormTo will generate the correct TO header and insert a Return-Path
       from the posted e-mail address
     - Changed detection of mod_perl to $ENV{MOD_PERL}. This makes sure that
       it will work correctly, even if Apache.pm isn't loaded.
     - Re-entered the optDisableEmbperlErrorPage, which was lost in one of the last
       releases, spotted by Doug Bagley.
     - The content_length of the Apache request_rec will only be set when a http
       header is sent.
     - If, Elsif and While metacommands now use SvTRUE instead of a != 0 to test the
       evaluated expression, so they now behave like the Perl ones do. Spotted by Jason
       Bondar

0.27-beta not available
=======================

0.26-beta 16 Mar 98
===================

     - Adapt include pass to compile with apache_1.3b5
     - Applied patch from Dan Walters to make Embperl compile with
       apache_1.3b3 and mod_perl on Win 32
     - Changed the order of included c headers and undef some macros
       inbetween (copied from mod_perl.c) to compile with Apache on Win 32
     - Embperl works with apache_1.3b5 on Win NT ('make test' does not yet)
       (You need the Apache source and must compile Perl with the vc++)

     - Added the 'param' parameter to the 'Execute' function to pass parameters
       from and to the Embperl document.
     - Added the 'fdat' and 'ffld' parameter to the 'Execute' function to
       setup %fdat and @ffld
     
     - Fixed a problem which displayed tables a second time after the end of
       the document, if dbgEarly HttpHeaders was on, thanks to Ask Bjorn Hansen
       for spotting this.
     - Fixed the return values of CheckFile, which was not correct after a change
       from 0.24 to 0.25. Thanks to Todd Eigenschrink for spotting this.
     - Fixed an error which was causing Embperl to crash on an HTML input tag without
       the 'type' parameter. Thanks to Todd Eigenschrink for the hint.
     - Fixed a problem that caused Embperl to not recognize errors correctly
       when reading the sourcefile

0.25-beta 17 Feb 1998
=====================

     - Included the "translation" of the Embperl POD to a human-readable
       form done by Todd Eigenschink
     - Started a FAQ file from the questions I answered by e-mail
     - Added the function Execute, which can be called from Perl programs
       (or Apache::Registry scripts), and can take input from (and/or
       output to) memory, as suggested by Doug Bagley and Randy Harmon
       (Look at test/html/registry/Execute.htm for an example)
     - Changed the source so that it will compile on aix, spotted by
       Patrick McAuliffe
     - Access sys_errlist via perl macro Strerror to avoid errors with
       redeclaration, thanks for spotting this to Honza Jirousek
     - Changed the tab size from 4 to 8 in my editor to be compatible with
       Unix standard
     - Added warning if dbgLogLink is set and EMBPERL_VIRTLOG is not
     - Changed the delimiter of metacommand from space to any non-alpha char
       to allow writing [$while(a==b)$] as suggested by Michael D. Dowling
     - Added config variable EMBPERL_ESCMODE to set inital values of $escmode
       as suggested by Todd Eigenschink
     - Added [! ... !]. Does just the same as [- ... -] but will only execute
       on the first request for that document. This can be used to do one-time
       initialization and to define subroutines.
     - Changed push_handlers to register_cleanup, so PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS and
       PERL_CLEANUP aren't necessary anymore, as suggested by Doug MacEachern
     - If it exists, the function CLEANUP of the processed document will be called
       before the variable cleanup, but after the connection to the client is closed
     - Added a closing </font> in the logfile which is sent to the browser, otherwise
       MS IE 4 can't handle it
     - Changed Perl constants in Perl part from subroutines to "real" constants
     - Did some general rearranging of code

     - Fixed a memory leak which caused Embperl to lose one sv per Perl
       block when a document is reloaded
     - Fixed a bug which caused [+... +] within the Textarea tag to be ignored,
       spotted by Todd Eigenschink
     - Fixed a bug in sorting hidden fields
     - Fixed a wrong argument to MakeMaker, which was causing Embperl to not be able
       to build statically, spotted by Anatoli Belomestnov (and added a
       description to the Faq on how to build a copy of Embperl which is statically-
       linked to mod_perl)
     - Fixed a problem which was causing the LOG filehandle to not be imported in
       the documents package, this was causing everything printed to LOG to sort
       of disappear
     
     =head1 0.24-beta 13 Jan 1998

     - Added the option optRawInput which causes Embperl not to pre-process the
       source for a Perl expression (the only exception is that CR will be removed).
       This option should be set when you are writing your code with an ascii editor.
       If you are using a WYSIWYG editor, which inserts unwanted HTML tags in your
       Perl expressions and escapes special characters automatically (i.e.
       < will occur as &lt; in the source), you should not set this option, and
       Embperl will automatically convert the HTML input back to the Perl
       expression you have written. (Thanks to Todd R. Eigenschink for a patch)
     - $0 is set to the filename of the HTML source
     - Change Current Working Directory to directory of HTML source
     - Warning messages are now also logged in logfile at the correct
       position, next to the source line
     - Perl error and warning messages contain the filename and correct
       linenumber of the HTML source
     - Sourcelines in logfile contain linenumbers
     - Output via [+ ... +] of undefined values at the end of a dynamic table
       (which must be there to end the table) do not generate a warning anymore
       NOTE: If you use them in an expression (such as $a = $arr[$row] or simply
       inside " ", you will still get a warning)
     - Open HTML source in binary mode on Win32 to avoid overhead of crlf -> lf
       translation.
     - Use aplog_error for apache_1.3 to avoid senseless os errors written to
       httpd error log

     - Removed some uninitializied value messages when running with
       -w / PerlWarn on, spotted by Todd R. Eigenschink
     - Fixed a bug which has caused nested 'while' loops to execute incorrectly
       if the condition of the outer one is false

0.23-beta 31 Dec 1997
=====================

     - Fixed a bug which caused $req_rec to be not defined anymore (Thanks to
       Todd R. Eigenschink for the hint and debugging)
     - Fixed a bug in escaping special HTML char to normal ascii (Thanks to
       Todd R. Eigenschink for the hint)
     - Makefile.PL now sets the path to your Perl binary in embpexec.pl and
       embpexec.test.pl, so that it works regardless of where your Perl is located
       (Thanks to Randall Schwartz for the hint)
     - Added the SSLDisable to the test config when running an httpsd. (Thanks
       to David Scott for the hint and Ralf S. Engelschall for the Syntax)
     - Fixed a bug in <META> tag interpretation which was causing random errors
       when not compiled for mod_perl

0.22-beta 28 Dec 1997
=====================

     - Changed include path generated in Makefile.PL so Embperl also
       compiles with apache_1.3b3 (Thanks to Doug Bagley for the hint)

0.21-beta 25 Dec 1997
=====================

     - Embperl offline mode now works under Win 32 (mod_perl and cgi mode
       not tested under Win 32 yet, but maybe it works too)
     - Totally reworked safenamespace and operatormask handling. Works now
       without memory leak, is fully configurable and also does p-code
       caching. If you use it, please look at the documentation, because
       the configuration has changed.
     - Embperl now sends its own error document if it detects an error.
       The page contains all the error messages and if you have the
       dbgLogLink enabled, all errors are links to the corresponding
       line in the logfile. (this can be disabled with optDisableEmbperlErrorPage)
     - Added new metacommand [$VAR ... $], which can be used to declare
       variables and apply the strict pragma (same as use strict ; use vars )
     - Added debug flag dbgHeadersIn which causes Embperl to log all http
       headers which are received from the client
     - Don't change any unknown HTML Escapes (i.e. && has been translated
       to ? in versions < 0.21)
     - dbgShowCleanup logs all variables which are automatically undefined at the
       end of a request (for scalars the value is also shown)
     - Error messages will also be cached, so that the compiling of the code
       only takes place once, because erroneous Perl code will cause memory
       leaks in Perl itself if it's compiled on and on and on.
     - Optimized the compiling of the embedded Perl code
     - Changed use Apache::Constants to conform with the new default exports
       introduced in mod_perl-1.07_01
     - Output of the 'hidden' metacommand is sorted in the same order as the input
       from the formfields (sorting order can also be supplied as third argument)
     - <meta http-equiv= ... > will override the corresponding http header
       (this keeps netscape from asking the user to reload the document
       when the content-type differs between the http header and the
       meta http-equiv)
       This can also be used to set http headers
     
     - Fixed a problem that Embperl magic variables do not work when
       the package exists before the first call to Embperl
     - Fixed a problem that caused a SIGSEGV when retrieving the same document
       containing a Perl error for the second time from the same child
     - Fixed a problem that caused Embperl to terminate in offline/cgi-mode
       when the file was not found or when access was forbidden
     - Fixed a problem with the 'hidden' metacommand, which came up when
       arguments were supplied with surrounding spaces
     - Fixed a problem that Embperl did not handle metacommands correctly
       when HTML tags (e.g. <br>) were embedded
     
     =head1 0.20-beta 15 Nov 97

     - Every file is executed in a separate package (don't confuse this
       with safe namespaces) to reduce unwanted effects on each other
     - Added the configuration directive EMBPERL_PACKAGE which can be used to override
       the automatically-generated package name
     - The namespace (package) used by a request is cleaned up afterwards.
       That means that every scalar, hash or array is undef'ed after the
       request to make sure nothing is lying around to possibly make the next request
       misbehave.
       This requires mod_perl with PERL_CLEANUP=1 and PERL_STACKED_HANDLER=1!
       NOTE: To get persistent variables, place them in another namespace i.e.
       write $persistent::x instead of $x
     - Added configuration directive EMBPERL_OPTIONS to configure various runtime
       options. Now only the scalar cleanup can be disabled.
     - use log_error for writing to Apache error log to get timestamp
     - Escaping inside an <A> tag is changed from an HTML escape to a URL escape
       i.e. the space is translated to + and & is translated to %26 and so on
     - Escaping can now be turned on and off via $escmode
     - Concats ENV and cgi_env under mod_perl so that PerlSetEnv can be used
       instead of SetEnv for configuration. In contrast to SetEnv, PerlSetEnv
       allows different values per directory/virtual host
     - Added two links to show source-loglines and eval-loglines when dbgLogLink
       is enabled to have a quick jump to the logfile
     - Reget pid for every request, so the correct one will be written to the
       logfile, also when Embperl is loaded at server startup
     - Check error log in make test, added test for error output

     - Fixed a bug which causes Embperl to cause a SIGSEGV when a Perl syntax
       error occurred
     - Fixed a bug so that a '>' inside of [+/- ... -/+] is not detected as the end
       of an HTML tag (Thanks to Todd R. Eigenschink)

0.19-beta 29 Oct 97
===================

     - Rewrote the code for the LOG handle. Now the handle LOG is tied so that every
       print/printf is written to embperl.log at the right position. Use this to
       do logging from your embedded code or modules
     
     - Fixed a bug which caused garbage to be displayed in dynamic tables (or made
       parts of the table disappear)

0.18-beta 25 Oct 97
===================

     - Added caching of p-code. Now all Perl code is compiled only once. On the
       second request, the compiled p-code is used. This makes, for example, the
       table.htm from the test about 4 times faster on the second run then it was in
       previous versions of Embperl. Also, tables and loops are faster in the first
       request, because the code is only compiled in the first iteration.
     - <Select>/<option> is now handled like <input>, this means that if a value
       for the select exists in %fdat, the corresponding option is automatically
       selected.
     - Added support for table heading (<th> tag). If all cells in a row are surrounded
       by <th>/</th> instead of <td>/</td> the row is interpreted as column headings and
       printed only once. Row headings are not supported yet, but in one of the next versions...
     - Added support for multipart/formdata to support fileupload. Embperl automatically
       detects  multipart/formdata and lets CGI.pm handle it. The results are also
       present in @ffld and %fdat like for normal formdata. See CGI.pm for more docs.
       (Thanks to eigenstr@mixi.net for the idea and material)
     - Now all the output is kept in memory and the http-header are sent when the
       processing is finish. This gives the ability to set http-headers (only under mod_perl)
       within the page. Also now the Content-Length can be sent in the http-header.
       (Thanks to eigenstr@mixi.net for the idea and material)
     - Added tests for mod_perl mode and running as cgi-script, if compilation
       for mod_perl is enabled (Thanks to Doug MacEachern for lots of ideas
       and code I have borrowed from his mod_perl)
     - Removed "= true" in MailFormTo which caused a warning and didn't declare
       syserr_list in ep.h on FreeBSD (Thanks to Michael Fuhr for the hints)
     - Added SYSNOPSIS section to docs to avoid pod2man warning and changed
       apache/src/regx to apache/src/regex in Makefile.PL (Thanks to Bob Wilkinson)
     - Splitted C-sources in some more source files

     - Fixed two minor memory leaks. Now the Embperl test suite can run 1000 times and
       more without making the httpd grow!

0.17-beta  30 Aug 97
====================

     - Removed some Compiler Warnings (Thanks to Ian Kallen for reporting them)

0.16-beta  29 Aug 97
====================

     - Added more restrictive access check when running under mod_perl
       * Option ExecCGI must be set
       * must not be a directory
     - Added a (few) more docs about how to view the Embperl logfile with
       your browser
     - Added a declaration for error-dependent stuff to compile on Solaris, check errno before
       accessing sys_errlist to avoid SIGSEVs, Fixed another warning from Sun Pro C Compiler
       (Thanks to Dan Peterson)
     - Switched I/O to PerlIO if supported by installed Perl version.
       Should now work with sfio (not tested yet)
     - Added possibilty to include Embperl commands in all HTML tags
       (did not work for body, table and tr tags in previous versions)
     - Will now preserve case of HTML tags
     - Do not interpret unknown HTML tags in any way, so as to handle "<" characters
       which do not start a HTML tag better
     - Do not display the time needed for the request if CLOCKS_PER_SEC not
       defined (e.g. SunOS - Thanks to Dan Peterson)
     - Added apache_xx/src/regx to include path, to avoid problems when
       Apache was built with its own regx library
     - Now Embperl shows which tags don't match in error message (table, dir, select etc.)
     
     - Fixed a bug which caused "[" characters to be printed even in a false
       if path

0.15-beta  11 July 1997
=======================

     - Added interpretation of SELECT Tag to generate dynamic listboxes
       from an arrary
     - Fixed a problem with dynamic lists
     - Fixed some warnings displayed by the Sun Pro C Compiler (Thanks to Dan Peterson)
     - Fixed an error message about missing IO::Handle
     - Changed all // comments to /* */ to be more compatible with compilers other
       than the gnu-c compiler
     - Inserted a missing return in oputc which caused a SIGSEV on Solaris  (Thanks
       to Dan Peterson)
     - Checked return code of Logfile open, to prevent a SIGSEV when Embperl cannot
       write to the logfile (it now writes an error message in server's errorlog)
       (Thanks to Dan Peterson)
     - Errors will also be logged to the server's error log (written to stderr)

0.14-beta 30 Juni 1997
======================

     - adding 8192 to EMBPERL_DEBUG and setting EMBPERL_VIRTLOG will add a link
       to Embperl output, so you can directly view the right part of the logfile
       with your browser
     - Added the LOG filehandle to print to the Embperl logfile
     - Added the possibility to handle multiple form fields with same name
     - chars which are a result of a Perl expression will not be escaped to HTML if
       they are prefixed with a backslash
     - Added support for scanning the parameters of input tags for Perl code i.e.
       [- -] and [+ +] substitution takes place
     - Replaced carriage return in Perl expression with space to avoid Perl 5.004 error
       about carriage return
     - added $req_rec to access the Apache server api when running under mod_perl

     - Fixed a bug in Safe namespace handling which was always causing ERR: 17 Namespace unknown
     - Fixed a bug which caused dynamic tables to end, if a 'if', 'while' and etc. was included
     - Fixed a bug that caused [$cmd$] to be executed only in the first iteration of a 'while'
       or a table
     - Fixed some bugs in input tag interpretation
     - Fixed a bug which occurred when Embperl encountered an input tag with value="" and %ffld=""
     - Fixed a bug in embpexec.pl that caused the options to be ignored when running offline

0.13-beta   April 26 1997
=========================

     - Moved EPENTRY (embperl_init) down to avoid crashing when compiled with
       -DEPDEBUGALL
     - Added #undefs for stdio function to compile with Perl > 5.003
       NOTE: This is a quick hack, and will be changed to use PerlIO in
       one of the next releases, so we can tie stdout of Embperl
     - Added pids (to distinguish between muliplite requests) and time to
       logfile output
     - Made many functions static and names of externals more unique to
       avoid conflicts of symbolnames with other modules
     - If file not found return status 404 instead of 500
     - Add Apache::Embperl so the module shows at CPAN also under
       module/by-module/Apache/ as suggested by Doug MacEachern
