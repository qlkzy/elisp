The Info Directory
******************


  The Info Directory is the top-level menu of major Info topics.
  Type "d" in Info to return to the Info Directory.  Type "q" to exit Info.
  Type "?" for a list of Info commands, or "h" to visit an Info tutorial.
  Type "m" to choose a menu item--for instance,
    "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs manual.
  In Emacs Info, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item
  or cross reference to follow it to its target.
  Each menu line that starts with a * is a topic you can select with "m".
  Every third topic has a red * to help pick the right number to type.
