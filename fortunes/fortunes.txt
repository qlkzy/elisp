distributed objects, has been used to control all kinds of devices

***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)
It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge 
in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not
sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, 
we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call 
"wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a 
wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  
IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom 
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so 
forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic 
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL 
succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed 
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those 
underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory
of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe 
IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly 
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

Conference] displaying some AspectJ to a silent crowd, pausing, then
plaintively adding, "When I show that to Java programmers they stand
up and cheer."

Lisp is the red pill.
              --- Seen in someone's sig
%
If you learn Lisp correctly, you can grok all programming styles with
it: procedural, OO, predicate, functional, pure or full of
side-effects. Recursion will be your friend, function references your
allies, you will truly know what a closure is, and that an argument
stack is actually a performance hack. You will see that the most
elegant way to solve a problem is to create a custom language, solve
the generic problem, and have your specific one fall out as a special
case. You will learn to truly separate intent from the bare metal, and
you will finally understand the two deepest secrets, which are really
the same secret, which we tell all, but so few understand, that code
and data are the same thing, but organize your data and your code will
follow.

Functional programming is like describing your problem to a
mathematician.  Imperative programming is like giving instructions to
an idiot.

In all the ways that matter, Perl is by *far* the most CL-like
language I've ever used - far closer to it than Scheme or Python,
which are basically written by the kind of people who would rather
spend their time in some kind of monastry flagellating themselves for
crimes against Computer Science.

<mmmdonuts> I see umbrellas as more of a device for reasoning about not getting wet.
<mmmdonuts> But that titanium dome sounds attractive.  We could attach turrets to it, too.
<mmmdonuts> The problem is that titanium rules out the transformation mechanism: you can't fold the umbrella.
<twb> mmmdonuts: not necessarily.

<mmmdonuts> Ah yes.  A titanium dome, and a portable nuclear-powered furnace.  Now *that's* what I call an umbrella.
